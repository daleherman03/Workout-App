# Workout-App
Personal project for code platoon

This workout app will call an api with over 1300 exercises to choose from. The user will select which exercises they want to do for their workout and enter in the sets and reps completed. After the workout, the app will save that data and recommend to decrease, increase the weight/sets/reps or keep them the same based on the goals of the user.
The app will also feature a nutrional database where users can track daily calories and set daily nutritional goals.
